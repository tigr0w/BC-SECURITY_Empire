  A persistence module that modifies an existing shortcut (.LNK) file to execute
  both the original target application and an Empire stager. By backdooring a
  shortcut already present on the system, the module ensures that normal user
  workflows are preserved while covertly establishing persistence.

  The module supports restoration of the original shortcut and can use either
  a stager or an external payload, providing flexibility in deployment and
  cleanup. This approach is particularly effective as it leverages existing
  user behavior patterns and doesn't require creating new files that might
  raise suspicion.

  The backdoor LNK technique provides a stealthy persistence mechanism that
  maintains the appearance of normal system operation while ensuring continued
  access through user-initiated shortcut execution.
