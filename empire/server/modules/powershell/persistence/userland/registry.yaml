  Establishes persistence by creating a registry entry in HKCU:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run
  that executes a stager or script during user logon. This module creates a user-level
  persistence mechanism that triggers when the specific user logs into the system.

  User-level registry persistence is less privileged than system-level persistence but provides
  reliable execution for the target user account. The module can store the payload
  in the registry, alternate data streams, event logs, or reference an external
  file, providing flexibility for different operational requirements and stealth
  considerations.

  This technique does not require administrative privileges and
  creates visible registry artifacts that can be detected by security monitoring
  tools.
