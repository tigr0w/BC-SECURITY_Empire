description: |
  A persistence module that monitors Windows security event logs for a specific
  trigger value. When the designated value is detected in an event log entry,
  the module initiates a callback to the attacker's server.

  This event-driven persistence technique leverages legitimate system logging
  mechanisms to provide a stealthy and flexible method for re-establishing
  access, as the backdoor is only activated in response to specific,
  operator-defined events. The module continuously scans security logs
  for the trigger value and maintains stealth by blending with normal
  system monitoring activities.

  The event log backdoor technique is particularly effective for maintaining
  long-term access as it uses legitimate system processes and can be
  triggered by various events that may occur naturally in the environment,
  providing a reliable and difficult-to-detect persistence mechanism.
