  Establishes persistence by creating a registry entry in HKLM:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run
  that executes a stager or script during system startup. This module creates a
  permanent persistence mechanism that survives reboots and user logon/logoff cycles.

  Registry-based
  persistence is one of the most common and well-known persistence techniques, making
  it relatively easy to detect and remove. However, it provides reliable execution
  and is often overlooked in basic security assessments. The module can store the
  payload in the registry itself or reference an external file, providing flexibility
  for different operational requirements.

  This technique requires administrative
  privileges and creates visible registry artifacts that can be \ndetected by security
  monitoring tools.
