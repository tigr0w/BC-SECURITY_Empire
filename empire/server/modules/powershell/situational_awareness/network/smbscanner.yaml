  A network reconnaissance module that performs SMB credential testing
  across multiple target systems. This module tests username and
  password combinations against Windows systems to identify valid
  credentials that can be used for lateral movement and privilege
  escalation.

  The module can target specific computers or automatically enumerate
  domain machines for credential testing. It supports both local and
  domain authentication, making it effective for identifying weak
  credentials across the network environment. The module includes
  options for ping-based host discovery and can use stored credentials
  from the Empire credential store.

  This technique is particularly effective for discovering shared
  credentials, default passwords, and weak authentication across
  network systems. Successful credential identification can provide
  immediate access to additional systems and facilitate lateral
  movement within the target environment. The module is based on
  research from @obscuresec and provides a systematic approach to
  network credential harvesting.
