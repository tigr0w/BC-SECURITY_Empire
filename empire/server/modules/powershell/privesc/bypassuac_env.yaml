  A privilege escalation module that bypasses User Account Control (UAC)
  by manipulating environment variables in the Windows registry. This
  technique exploits a vulnerability in how Windows handles environment
  variable expansion during elevated process creation.

  The module modifies the "windir" value in the Environment registry
  key to redirect system path resolution, allowing the execution of
  arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This technique is based on
  research by James Forshaw and can bypass UAC even when set to the
  highest "Always Notify" level.

  This approach is particularly effective as it doesn't require user
  interaction and can bypass most UAC configurations. However, it
  creates registry modifications that may be detected by security
  monitoring tools and requires cleanup after successful execution.
