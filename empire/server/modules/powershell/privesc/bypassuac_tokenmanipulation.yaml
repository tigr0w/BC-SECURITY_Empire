  A privilege escalation module that bypasses User Account Control (UAC)
  using Windows token manipulation techniques. This module is based on
  research presented by Matt Nelson (@enigma0x3) at Derbycon 2017 and
  implements token duplication to achieve elevated privileges.

  The technique exploits Windows security token handling by duplicating
  existing elevated tokens from running processes and using them to
  create new processes with administrative privileges. This approach
  bypasses UAC by leveraging tokens that already have the necessary
  privileges, rather than attempting to elevate through traditional
  means.

  This method is particularly effective because it doesn't require
  registry modifications or file system changes, making it completely
  fileless and difficult to detect. The technique works by identifying
  processes with elevated tokens and duplicating their security context
  to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.
