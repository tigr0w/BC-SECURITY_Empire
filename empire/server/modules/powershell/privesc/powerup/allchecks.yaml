  A comprehensive privilege escalation enumeration module that runs all
  available Windows privilege escalation checks from the PowerUp toolkit.
  This module performs a thorough assessment of the target system to
  identify potential privilege escalation vectors and misconfigurations.

  The module scans for various privilege escalation opportunities including
  service misconfigurations, unquoted service paths, weak service permissions,
  registry autorun entries, scheduled tasks, and other common Windows
  privilege escalation techniques. It examines system configurations,
  file permissions, registry settings, and service configurations to
  identify potential paths to elevated privileges.

  This comprehensive approach provides a complete picture of the target
  system's privilege escalation landscape, making it an essential tool
  for security assessments and penetration testing. The module is based
  on the PowerUp toolkit developed by @harmj0y and provides detailed
  output that can be used to plan targeted privilege escalation attacks.
