  A privilege escalation module that creates a malicious DLL for
  DLL hijacking attacks. This technique writes a custom DLL to a
  specified path along with a stager batch file that is called by
  the DLL when it is loaded by a target process.

  The module creates a DLL that, when loaded by a vulnerable process,
  executes the stager batch file to establish a connection with
  elevated privileges. This technique is particularly effective
  against processes that load DLLs from writable directories or
  have weak file permissions that allow DLL replacement.

  The module is designed to work with specific DLLs like wlbsctrl.dll
  on Windows 7 systems, where the target process expects to find
  the DLL in a specific location. When the system is restarted or
  the target process is launched, it loads the malicious DLL instead
  of the legitimate one, executing the stager with the process's
  elevated privileges. This approach is based on the PowerUp toolkit
  and represents a sophisticated method of DLL-based privilege escalation.
