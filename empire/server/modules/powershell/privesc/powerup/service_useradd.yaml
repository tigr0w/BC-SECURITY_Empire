  A privilege escalation module that abuses Windows services to create
  a local administrator account. This technique modifies the configuration
  of a target service to execute commands that create a new user and
  add them to the local Administrators group.

  The module identifies vulnerable services and modifies their
  configuration to include user creation commands. When the service
  starts or restarts, it executes these commands with elevated
  privileges, creating a new local administrator account that can
  be used for persistent access to the system.

  This technique is particularly effective because services often
  run with elevated privileges, allowing the creation of administrative
  accounts that would normally require administrative rights. The
  module provides options to specify the username, password, and
  target local group, making it flexible for different operational
  requirements. This approach is based on the PowerUp toolkit and
  represents a sophisticated method of service-based privilege escalation.
