  A privilege escalation module that bypasses User Account Control (UAC)
  using a fileless technique that exploits the Windows Event Viewer
  (eventvwr.exe) and registry hijacking. This technique performs an
  image hijack on the .msc file extension association to execute
  arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

  The module manipulates the registry to redirect .msc file execution
  to a custom handler, then triggers eventvwr.exe which attempts to
  load an .msc file. This causes the hijacked handler to execute with
  elevated privileges, bypassing UAC restrictions without dropping
  any files to disk.

  This approach is particularly stealthy as it's completely fileless
  and leverages legitimate Windows components. The technique was
  discovered by @enigma0x3 and represents a sophisticated method of
  UAC bypass that can evade many detection mechanisms.
