  Achieves persistence and code execution by manipulating the Windows
  Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debugger registry key via WMI. This technique
  sets a debugger for a specified application that will execute the attacker's
  payload whenever the targeted application is launched.

  The module uses WMI
  to remotely modify the registry on the target system, setting up the payload
  as a "debugger" for a legitimate application. When a user runs the targeted
  application, Windows will instead execute the payload first.

  This provides a
  stealthy persistence mechanism that doesn't require scheduled tasks, services,
  or startup items. It's particularly effective for maintaining access when the
  targeted application is commonly used or automatically started on the system.

  The
  technique can be detected through registry monitoring for changes to IFEO keys
  or through process ancestry analysis showing unexpected parent-child relationships
  when the targeted application is launched.
