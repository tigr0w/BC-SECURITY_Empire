  Executes commands or Empire stagers on remote systems using a modified
  implementation of the PsExec technique. Unlike Sysinternals PsExec, this PowerShell
  implementation creates a service on the remote system that executes the specified
  payload, then removes the service to eliminate evidence of execution.

  The
  module requires administrative credentials on the target system and uses SMB for
  connectivity, operating over standard ports (445/TCP). It supports both plaintext
  credentials and NTLM hashes (pass-the-hash) for authentication.

  While effective
  for lateral movement, this technique has significant OPSEC considerations as
  it creates artifacts including Windows service creation events, service binary
  writes, and potentially suspicious process execution chains. Modern EDR and monitoring
  solutions often specifically watch for PsExec-style execution patterns.
