  Executes PowerShell commands or Empire stagers on remote targets using
  MSBuild, Microsoft's build engine for .NET applications. This technique leverages
  MSBuild's ability to compile and execute inline C# code from XML project files,
  bypassing application allowlisting solutions that may block PowerShell.exe but
  trust MSBuild.exe.

  The module creates a specially crafted XML file that embeds
  the payload within an MSBuild project, then remotely triggers MSBuild to process
  this file, executing the payload in memory. Since MSBuild is a trusted Microsoft-signed
  binary (LOLBins technique), this execution method often evades traditional detection
  methods that focus on suspicious process lineage.

  Best used in environments
  where PowerShell execution is monitored or restricted but MSBuild.exe is available
  and not heavily monitored.
