  Executes commands or Empire stagers on remote systems by leveraging
  SQL Server's xp_cmdshell stored procedure. This technique enables lateral movement
  through SQL Server instances that have the xp_cmdshell feature enabled or where
  the attacker has sufficient privileges to enable it.

  The module connects to
  a remote SQL Server using provided credentials, enables the xp_cmdshell procedure
  if necessary (requiring sysadmin privileges), executes the specified command,
  and optionally disables xp_cmdshell afterward to cover tracks.

  This technique
  is particularly effective in environments where SQL Servers are trusted and less
  monitored than traditional endpoints. It operates over standard SQL Server ports
  (typically 1433/TCP) and can bypass network segmentation that might otherwise
  prevent direct access to target systems.

  Be aware that xp_cmdshell usage is
  often logged and may trigger alerts in security-conscious environments where
  SQL Server activity is monitored.
