  Exploits the Jenkins Script Console feature to execute arbitrary Groovy/Java
  code on Jenkins servers where the attacker has access to the console. This module
  allows for command execution or Empire stager deployment through Jenkins' built-in
  scripting functionality.

  The technique requires authenticated access to the
  Jenkins web interface with sufficient privileges to access the Script Console
  (typically admin privileges). Once accessed, the console allows execution of
  Groovy scripts in the context of the Jenkins server process, which typically
  runs with high privileges on the host.

  This approach is particularly effective
  for targeting DevOps infrastructure, as Jenkins servers often have extensive
  network access and trusted connections to other systems for CI/CD purposes. The
  module supports both direct command execution and downloading/executing files
  from remote sources.

  While Jenkins may log script console usage, many organizations
  don't actively monitor these logs, making this technique relatively stealthy
  compared to endpoint-based execution methods.
