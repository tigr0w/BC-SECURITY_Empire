description: Executes a PowerShell-based prank that plays the melody of Rick Astley's
  "Never Gonna Give You Up" using the system speaker, delivering an audible "Rickroll"
  to the target user. This module leverages a script that generates a sequence of
  beeps corresponding to the song's notes, surprising and amusing the user with a
  recognizable tune. The technique is intended for humorous psychological operations,
  red team morale-boosting, or lighthearted demonstrations, and is non-destructive
  in nature. The prank is instantly recognizable and can be used to inject levity
  into engagements or to test user awareness. No administrative privileges are required,
  and the prank is harmless, leaving no persistent changes on the system. Use responsibly
  and with consideration for the target audience.
