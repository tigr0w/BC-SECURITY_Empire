## MainAgent Class

The `MainAgent` class manages the core functionality of the agent after the staging process. It handles communication with the Empire server, tasking execution, and results reporting.

### Attributes

- **packet_handler**: The `PacketHandler` instance responsible for encrypting/decrypting messages to/from the server.
- **server**: The base URL of the command and control (C2) server.
- **session_id**: A unique identifier for the current session.
- **kill_date**: The date when the agent will terminate itself.
- **working_hours**: The agent's allowed operation window.

### Methods

#### `run()`
Continuously checks in with the Empire server for new tasking, executes the commands, and sends back results. This method will run until the `kill_date` is reached or the agent is otherwise terminated.

#### `check_in()`
Communicates with the server to check for new tasks.

#### `execute_command(command)`
Executes a command on the host system and returns the result.

### Usage Example

```go
agent := MainAgent{...}
agent.run()
```
